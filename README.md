## ✨ Features

### 🎯 Interactive Trailing Cursor
The website features a beautiful trailing cursor animation that:
- **Follows your mouse** with smooth, fluid motion
- **Creates a trail** of colorful dots that fade as they follow
- **Changes appearance** when hovering over clickable elements
- **Auto-hides** after 2 seconds of inactivity for better UX
- **Responsive design** that works on all screen sizes

**Cursor States:**
- **Default**: White dot with glowing effect
- **Hover**: Larger pink dot when over buttons/links
- **Click**: Smaller yellow dot when clicking

The trailing effect creates multiple dots with different colors (pink, cyan, yellow) that follow your cursor with staggered delays, creating a mesmerizing visual effect.
